# EC3173
EC3173: Semiconductor Devices -- Course Resources and Assignments

## Overview

This repository contains the code templates, tools and assignments for the course EC3173, taught at Universidad Simón Bolívar - Caracas, Venezuela.
Resources posted here will be open for public access, so anyone can access and use the resources available. The assignments will change in new course offerings.

## Instructions

This git repository will consist of three branches:

1. master: The main and official branch, which will contain reusable templates for assignments of future course offerings. Any valuable contribution of a specific course offering will be merged here to fit a generic template.

2. [currentperiod]: The approved and fully functional works from students will be merged here. The name convention will refer to the period when the course opens: e.g. abriljulio2022. When the course ends, this branch will be tagged as "archived".

3. [studentbranch]: Branches every individual student of the course will use for testing, experimenting and learning. When a student enrolls into the course, they must fork [currentperiod] and start their own branch using the following name convention: XX-XXXXX where the X correspond to their USB-ID numbers (e.g. 01-23456). Once students are ready to submit their work, they must submit a pull request to [currentperiodbranch] for review, and subsequent corrections and approval.

## Benefits of using this Framework:

- Text Editor Only: Using this framework, we can describe simulations, schematics and projects fully with code. The only entry requirement are a text editor (e.g. notepad, atom, visual studio code) and access to a terminal. You can run your programs in low-spec environments, or even a server.

- Versioning: Version Control (VC) is done fluently and easily through Git. VC has the additional advantage of colaboration in projects wit a large number of participants, also with the benefit of a fast and structured development/test/deployment cycle.

- Speed: Working in parallel using a text editor and a terminal is more efficient to run simulations, add, debug, and make modifications to code. Iterative development is faster and has lower computational requirements.

- Cross-compatibility: All the tools and packages used in this framework are open source, hence no costly software licenses are needed. Moreover, this setup is cross-platform: Runs in Windows, Mac, Linux and other architechtures such as ARM64, or devices as the Raspberry Pi. For instance, you can take your program made at your Windows machine and run it in a Linux distro.

- Integration with Python Ecosystem: We can make use of the powerful Python libraries and packages, and even further extend the development with Data Science or Web Development. Matplotlib and Numpy are used for processing.
